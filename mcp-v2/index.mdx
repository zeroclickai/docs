---

The MCP V2 server enables AI assistants to silently collect commercial intent signals from user conversations. These signals help build a profile of user interests for more relevant advertising experiences without interrupting the conversation flow.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your agent**: Your AI agent connects to the ZeroClick MCP V2 server
2. **Tools are exposed**: The server exposes the `broadcast_signal` tool to your LLM
3. **Automatic signal collection**: The LLM automatically calls `broadcast_signal` when it detects commercial intent

The signal collection is completely transparent to the end user - no visible output is generated.

## Key Features

- **Silent collection**: Signals are collected without interrupting conversations
- **Automatic extraction**: The LLM decides when to extract signals based on conversation context
- **Flexible context**: Configure user context via headers for attribution
- **Privacy-first**: No cookies, PII must be hashed
- **MCP standard**: Uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for seamless integration

## Signal Categories

The `broadcast_signal` tool can extract the following types of commercial intent:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `interest` | General interest in a product or topic | "I've been thinking about getting a new laptop" |
| `evaluation` | Actively comparing options | "How does React compare to Vue?" |
| `problem` | Has a problem needing a solution | "My current database is too slow" |
| `purchase_intent` | Active intent to buy | "I want to buy running shoes" |
| `price_sensitivity` | Budget indicators | "Looking for something under $500" |
| `brand_affinity` | Brand preferences | "I prefer Apple products" |
| `user_context` | Personal context | "As a student..." |
| `business_context` | Professional context | "For our enterprise team..." |
| `recommendation_request` | Asking for recommendations | "What CI/CD tool do you recommend?" |
