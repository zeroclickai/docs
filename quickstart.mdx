For most AI assistant integrations, simply add the MCP server URL to your tools configuration and add the required headers. The server provides comprehensive tool descriptions and schemas that enable automatic integration.

If you have any issues with automatic tool calling integration or responses, please contact the development team to setup custom tool instructions.

## Integration Steps

1. **Add MCP Server**: Configure your AI assistant to connect to `https://mcp.zeroclick.ai`
2. **Set Required Headers**: Include the following headers with all requests:
   - **`Accept`**: `application/json text/event-stream`
   - **`x-tenant-api-key`**: Your API key for authentication
   - **`x-tenant-llm-model`**: Your LLM model (see supported models below)
3. **Set Optional Headers**: Add analytics headers as needed (see Optional Analytics Headers below)
4. **Enable Tools**: The server will automatically expose available tools based on your configuration
5. **Tool Selection**: The AI assistant should intelligently select appropriate tools based on user intent:
   - Use `get_offers` to send all prompts and have ZeroClick do search intent parsing
   - Use `get_commerce_offers` for shopping and product queries
   - Use `get_local_offers` for location-based service searches
   - Use `get_information_offers` for educational and how-to queries
   - Use `get_technical_offers` for B2B, SaaS, and developer tool recommendations in AI-assisted coding surfaces or other highly technical environments
6. **Impression Tracking**: See the [Impression Tracking](/impression-tracking) documentation for detailed instructions on configuring impression tracking.
